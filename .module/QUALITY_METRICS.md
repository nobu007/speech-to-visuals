// Auto-generated quality assessment example
export class QualityMonitor {
  private metrics: QualityMetrics = {
    // Real-time tracking
    processingTimes: [],
    errorRates: [],
    accuracyScores: [],
    userSatisfaction: []
  };

  async assessPipelineQuality(result: PipelineResult): Promise<QualityAssessment> {
    const assessment = {
      timestamp: new Date(),
      overallScore: 0,
      recommendations: [],
      concerns: []
    };

    // Performance Assessment
    const perfScore = this.assessPerformance(result.processingTime);
    assessment.overallScore += perfScore * 0.3;

    // Accuracy Assessment
    const accuracyScore = this.assessAccuracy(result.scenes);
    assessment.overallScore += accuracyScore * 0.4;

    // Reliability Assessment
    const reliabilityScore = this.assessReliability(result.stages);
    assessment.overallScore += reliabilityScore * 0.3;

    // Generate recommendations
    if (perfScore < 0.8) {
      assessment.recommendations.push("Consider performance optimization");
    }
    if (accuracyScore < 0.75) {
      assessment.recommendations.push("Review content analysis accuracy");
    }

    return assessment;
  }

  private assessPerformance(processingTime: number): number {
    // Target: < 30s for 60s audio (2x realtime)
    const targetRatio = 2.0;
    const actualRatio = 60000 / processingTime; // Assuming 60s audio
    return Math.min(actualRatio / targetRatio, 1.0);
  }

  private assessAccuracy(scenes: SceneGraph[]): number {
    let totalScore = 0;
    let sceneCount = scenes.length;

    scenes.forEach(scene => {
      // Check layout quality
      const layoutScore = this.assessLayoutQuality(scene);

      // Check content relevance
      const contentScore = this.assessContentRelevance(scene);

      // Check timing accuracy
      const timingScore = this.assessTimingAccuracy(scene);

      totalScore += (layoutScore + contentScore + timingScore) / 3;
    });

    return sceneCount > 0 ? totalScore / sceneCount : 0;
  }

  private assessLayoutQuality(scene: SceneGraph): number {
    // Check for overlaps, readability, aesthetics
    const hasOverlaps = this.detectOverlaps(scene.layout);
    const readabilityScore = this.assessReadability(scene.layout);
    const balanceScore = this.assessVisualBalance(scene.layout);

    return hasOverlaps ? 0 : (readabilityScore + balanceScore) / 2;
  }
