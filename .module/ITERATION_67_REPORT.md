## 💡 Recommendations & Next Actions

### Priority 1: Reliability Enhancement (Critical)

**Issue**: Error recovery scenario achieved only 26% reliability (target: 90%)

**Root Causes**:
1. Success rate: 0% in error scenario (simulated failure)
2. Stage completion rate: 40% when errors occur
3. Error handling scored 70% (adequate but not excellent)

**Recommended Improvements**:

```typescript
// 1. Enhanced Error Recovery in Pipeline
async function processWithRetry(input, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const result = await process(input);
      if (result.success) return result;

      // Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
      await sleep(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000);
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      console.warn(`Attempt ${attempt} failed, retrying...`);
    }
  }
}

// 2. Graceful Degradation
function providePartialResults(stages) {
  // Even if video generation fails, provide:
  // - Transcription results
  // - Scene analysis
  // - Diagram layouts
  return {
    success: 'partial',
    availableResults: extractCompletedStages(stages)
  };
}

// 3. Enhanced Error Logging and Recovery Suggestions
function suggestRecoveryActions(error, context) {
  return {
    error,
    recovery: getRecoveryStrategy(error.type),
    userActions: generateUserGuidance(error),
    automaticRetry: determineRetryability(error)
  };
}
```

### Priority 2: Continuous Integration

**カスタムインストラクション: 7.1 コミットタイミング**

Implement automated quality checks in CI/CD pipeline:
- Pre-commit hooks for quality validation
- Automated test execution on push
- Quality reports in PR reviews

### Priority 3: Performance Monitoring Dashboard

**Future Enhancement**:
- Real-time quality metrics visualization
- Historical trend analysis
- Automated alerting for quality degradation
