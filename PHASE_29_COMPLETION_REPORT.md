## Technical Discoveries

### Issue #1: Enhanced Zero Overlap Layout Engine Bug

**Description**: EnhancedZeroOverlapLayoutEngine throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')` error.

**Root Cause**: Nodes generated by GeminiAnalyzer/DiagramDetector don't have initial position data (`x`, `y` properties).

**Workaround**: Phase 29 uses standard LayoutEngine (`useEnhancedLayout: false`)

**Fix Required**: Initialize node positions in layout engine before collision detection (estimated: 1-2 hours)

**Priority**: HIGH (blocks zero-overlap guarantee for complex layouts)

### Issue #2: Processing Time Slightly Over Target

**Description**: Total pipeline time 35.62s exceeds 30s threshold.

**Breakdown** (estimated):
- Transcription: ~0.5s
- LLM Analysis (4 scenes, 2 API calls): ~22s
- Layout Generation: ~1s
- Video Rendering: ~12s

**Optimization Opportunities**:
1. **LLM Calls**: Use semantic caching to reduce repeated calls (expected: -10s)
2. **Video Rendering**: Implement progressive rendering (expected: -5s)
3. **Parallel Processing**: Already enabled (Phase 14), but could be tuned

**Expected Improvement**: 35.62s → ~20s (44% reduction)
