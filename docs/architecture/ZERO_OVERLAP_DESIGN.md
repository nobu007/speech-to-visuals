# Zero-Overlap Layout Engine Design

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Issues
- Force-directed layout gets stuck in local minima
- 6 overlaps remain after 300 iterations
- No fallback mechanism when force-directed approach fails
- Inefficient overlap detection (O(n²) complexity)

### Requirements
- **100% overlap-free** layouts for all diagram types
- **Maintain aesthetic quality** (minimal edge crossings, balanced layout)
- **Performance** under 2 seconds for typical diagrams (<20 nodes)
- **Deterministic** results for same input
- **Type-specific optimizations** for all 5 diagram types

## 2. Multi-Strategy Architecture

```typescript
interface LayoutStrategy {
  name: string;
  apply(nodes: Node[], edges: Edge[]): LayoutResult;
  canEscapeLocalMinimum: boolean;
  estimateComplexity(nodes: Node[]): number;
}
```

### 2.1 Strategy 1: Progressive Force-Directed
**Purpose**: Primary layout engine for most cases
**Algorithm**:
1. Start with standard force-directed layout
2. If overlaps remain, increase repulsion force
3. If still stuck, reduce damping factor
4. Use adaptive step size based on improvement rate

### 2.2 Strategy 2: Simulated Annealing
**Purpose**: Escape local minima in complex layouts
**Algorithm**:
1. Start with current (overlapping) layout
2. Randomly perturb node positions
3. Accept better solutions, probabilistically accept worse
4. Gradually reduce temperature (acceptance probability)

### 2.3 Strategy 3: Grid-Snap Fallback
**Purpose**: Guaranteed zero-overlap for difficult cases
**Algorithm**:
1. Calculate bounding box of all nodes
2. Determine grid size based on largest node
3. Place nodes on grid points using depth-first search
4. Optimize for minimal edge crossings

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.2 Performance Optimizations

#### Spatial Hashing
- Reduce overlap detection from O(n²) → O(n)
- Dynamic grid size based on node distribution
- Incremental updates for moving nodes

#### Parallel Processing
- Independent node position updates
- Batch processing for force calculations
- Web Workers for CPU-intensive operations

### 3.3 Type-Specific Optimizations

| Type      | Primary Strategy      | Fallback Strategy     | Special Considerations          |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Flow      | Progressive Force    | Grid-Snap           | Emphasize flow direction       |
| Tree      | Hierarchical Layout  | Grid-Snap           | Parent-child relationships     |
| Timeline  | Force (X-constrained)| Grid-Snap           | Fixed Y-axis for time          |
| Matrix    | Grid-Snap            | N/A                 | Strict grid alignment          |
| Cycle     | Circular Layout      | Force-Directed      | Maintain circular structure    |
