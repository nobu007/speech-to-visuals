Next, the Order Service processes e-commerce transactions and communicates with the Payment Service through REST APIs. The Notification Service sends emails and push notifications asynchronously. Finally, all services log to Elasticsearch for monitoring and debugging. This distributed system ensures scalability and fault tolerance.",
